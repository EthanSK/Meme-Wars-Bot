# Meme Wars Bot

This is on of my favourite and more complex bots from the days of the meme empire. 

The facebook page it acted on is https://www.facebook.com/memewarsincomments/
however, all the posts were zucced, so sadly you can't see it working (although I promised it did - that's how it got all those likes)

### What did the bot do??
Simply put, it runs a facebook page that enables anyone to have meme wars with each other in the comments of each post. Whoever's meme comment got the most likes (or reactions) would have their meme posted next, with credits. People were only eligible if they liked other comments, a measure taken to ensure fair participation of the 'game', else the bot auto replied explaining that they would have won had they read the instructions properly.

Also, since some people were posting zuccworthy memes, I added an extra level of safety by creating a messenger bot webhook that messaged my account asking if the meme about to be posted is appropriate. If i reply to this bot 'no', it automatically comments on the offender's meme comment telling them they are being naughty grr. 


### Why is the code so shit??
I was a n00b back then. Sorry.


#### P.S.
There is a bunch of random old code from previous generations of the bot, eg when it posted a random comment instead of the most liked one...cba to clean this up.
